2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you

   Problem 1 (Autocomplete Term): The problem I face was compartors. I solved
 them by applying many combinations of x (In my code, which compare the string
 lenght and comparing string length) because I was having problem of outofbound
 error.

   Problem 2 (Binary Search Deluxe): Main problem was, how to check that it is 
first or last or somewhere in middle of the string we have to find. which I
 solved by binary search.

   Problem 3 (Autocomplete): This was just done with use of above 2. But I had
 a problem in which I have to make 2 temporary array to dump output.
